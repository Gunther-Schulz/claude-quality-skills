# Classifier Hooks (deprecated branch)

**Status:** Deprecated as of 2026-04-02. Preserved for reference.

This branch contains the Haiku-based classifier hook that was removed from `main`. Claude Code's built-in skill auto-discovery handles the common cases without the latency (~2-6s) and cost (~$0.008/call) of the `claude -p` subprocess.

## What this branch has that main doesn't

- `plugin/hooks/hooks.json` — hook config for UserPromptSubmit
- `plugin/hooks/scripts/claude-skill-classifier` — Python script that classifies prompts via `claude -p` with Haiku and injects skill reminders
- `plugin/hooks/scripts/claude-hook-logger` — debug logger (off by default)
- `.claude/auto-skills.local.md` config with classifier settings (sensitivity, model, categories)

## Known issue at time of deprecation

The classifier's `claude -p` call was returning empty output in some environments. This was not fully debugged — the root cause may be related to how the system prompt is passed as a positional argument.

## When to reconsider

- If Claude Code's auto-discovery misses skills for short/ambiguous prompts ("yes", "do it", "sounds good" after a design discussion)
- If agent-type hooks ([#26474](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26474)) or prompt-type context injection ([#37559](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/37559)) become available — these would replace the `claude -p` subprocess with native inline classification
- If per-project sensitivity tuning is needed (auto-discovery has no sensitivity levels)

## To restore

```bash
git checkout classifier-hooks -- plugin/hooks/
```

Then push and reinstall the plugin.
